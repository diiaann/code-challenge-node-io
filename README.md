I found this little coding challenge I did years past for a job interview. The problem was to be able to take a few files and link them up wiki style. Basically shows that I have some knowlede of node I/O and can solve a basic string parsing problem. As such the solution to render the wiki'fied pages in html was a quick and dirty way to get the job done.

To run:

`npm install`

`node index.js`
